GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is primarily used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.

GitHub provides a platform for collaborative software development where multiple developers can work on a project simultaneously. It allows developers to work on their own branch, without affecting the main codebase. Changes can be merged into the main codebase through a process called a pull request.

GitHub is also an important tool for open-source projects. It provides a platform where developers can share their code with the world and collaborate with other developers. It also includes features like issue tracking, code reviewing, and project management.

In addition, GitHub offers a marketplace for developers to share and sell their software, a platform for documentation, and a community where developers can discuss and share ideas.

Overall, GitHub is a crucial tool for modern software development, facilitating collaboration, code sharing, and version control.
